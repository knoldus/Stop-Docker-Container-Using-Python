#### A Python library for the Docker Engine API. It lets you do anything the docker command does, but from within Python apps – run containers, manage containers, manage Swarms, etc. Docker provides an API for interacting with the Docker daemon (called the Docker Engine API), as well as SDKs for Python. The SDKs allow you to build and scale Docker apps and solutions quickly and easily. If Go or Python don’t work for you, you can use the Docker Engine API directly. You can check this link here<a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/" target="_blank"> link</a>.


You can use this template for the list of stopped containers and it also will stop the running container.

-----

### Steps :-
1. First install the docker library in your system.

          pip install docker

2. Now you can run this file and all containers will be stopped and list.

            python3 container_stop.py
